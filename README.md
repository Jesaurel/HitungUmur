# 🎂 Age Calculator (JavaScript)

Simple age calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project calculates a user's age based on their birth date, including proper handling when the birthday hasn’t occurred yet this year.

✨ Designed with a clean UI and subtle animations.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Calculate age from birth date
- Correct logic for birthdays not yet passed
- Smooth number counting animation
- Minimal & modern UI
- No framework, no library

---

## 🧠 Core Logic
The age is calculated by:
1. Subtracting birth year from the current year
2. Checking if the birthday has already occurred this year
3. Reducing the age by 1 if it hasn’t

This prevents the common **off-by-one age bug** found in many forms.
